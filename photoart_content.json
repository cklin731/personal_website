        "description": "This book presents online chat room communication through handmade photography. Unlike face-to-face conversations, online chats often lack continuity, leading to communication breakdowns without facial cues. Created by authors from Taiwan(Yu-Lin Tsai) and Switzerland(Yi-Kai Chen), the book documents a month-long exchange solely through photos. Viewers decide the conversation's pace, achieving a unique asynchronous communication experience.",

As communication technology evolves, public telephones have become overlooked objects.

By locating these disappearing public telephones, they ultimately create a survival map of urban communication spots.",

        "description": "This piece contrasts the before and after of still-life decay through photography, merging the frozen-in-time nature of imagery with the inevitable decay of the film itself as a material. It presents a series of images with multiple layers of contrast. Ultimately, it is presented in the form of a double-sided photography book, printed on fragile paper, ensuring that the book gradually deteriorates during its exhibition as viewers flip through its pages.",
