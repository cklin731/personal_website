        "description": "The piece captures public telephones within the author's urban environment, documenting the GPS coordinates of each one. As communication technology evolves, public telephones have become overlooked objects. The author seeks to empathize with those who have lost access to communication devices like mobile phones, exploring the sentiment of searching for communication lifelines in the city. By locating these disappearing public telephones, they ultimately create a survival map of urban communication spots.",

Leveraging social media data, the project showcases emotion generation and interactive interfaces, delving into reflections on the standardization of individual consciousness. It observes the interaction between AI and social media.",

        "description": "This book presents online chat room communication through handmade photography. Unlike face-to-face conversations, online chats often lack continuity, leading to communication breakdowns without facial cues. Created by authors from Taiwan(Yu-Lin Tsai) and Switzerland(Yi-Kai Chen), the book documents a month-long exchange solely through photos. Viewers decide the conversation's pace, achieving a unique asynchronous communication experience.",

        "description": "This piece contrasts the before and after of still-life decay through photography, merging the frozen-in-time nature of imagery with the inevitable decay of the film itself as a material. It presents a series of images with multiple layers of contrast. Ultimately, it is presented in the form of a double-sided photography book, printed on fragile paper, ensuring that the book gradually deteriorates during its exhibition as viewers flip through its pages.",

While computer-generated randomness isn't truly random, this device simulates genuine randomness with dust. It also ties to the Infinite Monkey Theorem, suggesting that over time, it can generate any image, including photos from each piece exhibited.",
